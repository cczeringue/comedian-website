# Press Logos

## Why are the images broken?

The logo image files are missing from this directory. You need to add the actual logo image files here.

## Required Logo Files

Add these 6 image files to this `logos/` directory:

1. `nytimes-logo.png` - The New York Times logo
2. `hollywood-reporter-logo.png` - The Hollywood Reporter logo  
3. `independent-logo.png` - The Independent logo
4. `fox-news-logo.png` - FOX News logo
5. `cnn-logo.png` - CNN logo
6. `the-hill-logo.png` - The Hill logo

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **Size**: Maximum height: 60px, Maximum width: 180px
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display on all screens

## How to Add the Logos

1. Save/download the logo images from the press websites or use the logo images you have
2. Rename them to match the exact filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `logos/` directory
4. Refresh your browser - the images should now display correctly!

## Temporary Fallback

Until you add the image files, the site will show styled text labels instead of broken image icons. Once you add the logo images, they will automatically replace the text labels.
