To add your hero image:

1. Save your image file (the one with you on the pink background) 
   as "hero-image.jpg" in this directory: /Users/calebz/comedian-website/

2. Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png

3. The image will automatically display on the right side of the hero section

If your image has a different name, let me know and I'll update the code!
